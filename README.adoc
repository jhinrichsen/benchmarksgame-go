Go implementations for Benchmarksgame (aka language shootout)

http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org[Benchmarksgame]

== thread-ring

This benchmark should be the ideal candidate to showcase CSP concepts in Go. In
theory, Go should blow away any other programming langage that relies on OS
threading. However, Go only rates second after Haskell. Haskell makes use of
`lightweight, unbound threads` which are not OS threads, so that makes sense.
So, the goal is to close the gap between Haskell's 9:45, and Go's 14:71 [s].


== Timings


=== Running the original thread-ring #6
----
$ go test -bench=. -cpu=1,2,4,8
BenchmarkThreadRing6     	       1	24494436828 ns/op
BenchmarkThreadRing6-2   	       1	17444699100 ns/op
BenchmarkThreadRing6-4   	       1	22363000889 ns/op
BenchmarkThreadRing6-8   	       1	26643745947 ns/op
PASS
----

That's 24, 17, 22, and 26 s for 1, 2, 4 and 8 CPUs. The benchmark's result for a
fixed GOMAXPROCS=1 is 14s, so my testbed is approx. 1.7 times slower.

If the benchmark is run with one CPU only, the result is
----
go test -bench=. -cpu=1  
BenchmarkThreadRing6 	       1	5956264597 ns/op
PASS
----
Under 6 seconds. A quarter of the original 24x without any source code change.
This might be a result of the package scope variable `res`, a `chan int` which
is re-used between benchmark runs.

=== Change #1

Refactor the package variable into a function parameter. Does not influence the
result, still 6 s for a 1 CPU test run, and 24 s for a multiple CPU run.

TODO find out where this difference stems from.

== Performance improvement #1

Many Go implementations make use of a synchronized struct T.
